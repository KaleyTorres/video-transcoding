The newly updated MacX Video Converter Pro version (https://www.macxdvd.com/download/macx-video-converter-pro.dmg) is more powerful than the free one. It's an all-in-one Mac video converter, compressor, downloader, editor, screen recorder & slideshow maker.  
Also worth noting is that the Pro version enhanced with unique hardware acceleration, thus you can enjoy a boosted 4K/HD video converting speed to an unbeatably new level (5X faster than traditional converters) by utilizing Intel Quick Sync Video. Still, the auto copy feature makes you reformat a video (e.g. MKV to MP4) like copy & paste. No re-encoding or quality degradation. It takes just 1 min to convert a full HD movie.
